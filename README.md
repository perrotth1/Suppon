#Suppon War Driver
#Henry Perrottet

This set of scripts allows the raspberry pi to be used as a war driver device. Its basic purpose 
is to scan nearby networks, select one as a target, crack the network passcode, then connect to 
the network and begin gathering information on the connected devices. It will be able to do much
more than that however. It has various added functionality and hardware devices that make it a 
versatile security tool. The functions are devided into three modes (each with its respective 
folder).

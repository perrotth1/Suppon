#Recon Mode

In this final mode, the war driver has connected to the network. It will do a series of scans on 
the network to gain information about what devices are connected. With the information it will 
start a recon web interface that shows a diagram of the network topology, allows the user to SSH
into the device, shows the user pictures taken through a hidden camera if someone comes too close,
and more. With all this info and a connected device inside the network with an SSH tunnel, the 
user will have a great foothold into the network.
